# 1. Introduction 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of a custom hook that is designed to replicate the behavior of the TanStack Query hook. The custom hook simplifies data fetching in a React application, enhancing efficiency and maintainability. We will explore the functionality, key features, and implementation details of the custom hook, and compare data fetching techniques before and after using the useQuery hook. 

 
# 2. Understanding the React Query Hook

The TanStack Query hook, commonly known as useQuery, is designed to manage server-state in React applications. It abstracts away the complexities of fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server-state. By using this hook, developers can focus on building UI components without worrying about the complexity of data fetching. 

*Core Concepts and API* 

The core concepts of the useQuery hook include: 

      Queries: Represent the request to fetch data. Queries can be uniquely identified using keys. 
      Query Keys: Unique identifiers for queries, allowing the hook to cache and manage them efficiently. 
      Query Functions: Functions that fetch data, often returning a promise. 
      Caching: The hook caches data to avoid unnecessary requests and improve performance. 
      Automatic Re-fetching: Data can be automatically re-fetched based on specified conditions, ensuring up-to-date information. 

 

The primary API provided by the useQuery hook includes: 

      queryKey: Unique identifier for the query. 
      queryFn: Function to fetch the data. 
      config: Configuration options for the query (e.g., caching, re-fetching conditions). 


# 3. Implementation Details 

The internal usages of the useQuery hook involve several processes: 

Initialization: Setting up the query with its key and function. 

Data Fetching: Executing the query function to retrieve data. 

Data Caching: Storing the fetched data in a cache, identified by the query key. 

State Management: Tracking the loading, error, and success states of the query. 

Re-fetching: Determining when to re-fetch data based on conditions such as time, visibility, or user actions. 

 

## Key Features

The key features of the useQuery hook include: 

    Automatic Caching: Reduces repeated network requests by caching data. 

    Background Re-fetching: Keeps data up to date without blocking the UI. 

    Stale Time and Cache Time: Configurable options to control how long data remains fresh and when it is removed from the cache. 

    Error Handling: Simplified error handling with built-in states. 

    Pagination and Infinite Queries: Support for handling large datasets through pagination or infinite scrolling. 


# 4. Comparison with Previous Data Fetching Techniques

### Before using the useQuery hook, data fetching involved manual state management, which was error-prone and repetitive. The steps typically included: 

Initiating a fetch request. 

Handling loading, success, and error states manually. 

Implementing caching mechanisms from scratch. 

Re-fetching data based on specific conditions manually. 

### After adopting the useQuery hook, these challenges are mitigated: 

The hook automatically manages loading, success, and error states. 

Built-in caching and re-fetching logic simplifies implementation. 

Built-in Api re-trying logic simplifies implementation. 

The API is intuitive and reduces boilerplate code.  

# 5. Query and Mutation Use Cases


**Queries**

Queries are used to fetch and cache data from a server. They are read-only operations that do not alter the server state. Typical use cases for queries include: 

Fetching information from an API. 

Retrieving a list of items from a database. 

Loading configuration settings. 

**Pros** 

Efficient Caching: Reduces redundant network requests, improving performance. 

Automatic Re-fetching: Ensures data is up to date, enhancing reliability. 

Simplified State Management: Handles loading, success, and error states internally, reducing boilerplate code. 

**Mutations** 

Mutations are used to create, update, or delete data on the server. They are write operations that alter the server state. Typical use cases for mutations include: 

Submitting a form to create a new user. 

Updating information on server. 

Deleting information. 

**Pros** 

Optimistic Updates: Immediately reflect changes in the UI, providing a responsive user experience. 

Error Handling: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors during data modification. 

Re-fetching Queries: Automatically re-fetches affected queries to keep data consistent. 

# Impact on Project 

Implementing queries and mutations using the custom hook has several positive impacts: 

Increased Performance: Caching and efficient data management reduce the load on the server. 

User Experience Improved: Automatic updates and error handling provide a smooth and reliable interface.
